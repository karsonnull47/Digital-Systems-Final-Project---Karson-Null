# Number Conversion

### Every value is represented by ones and zeroes, the rightmost number represents the number one, and for every step left, the number being represented is doubled, and so on and so forth.  Every 1 adds that number to the final total.  This covers every possible number using the right combination of numbers.

Values:
128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1

So for the value of 100, you'd match up the placement of possible values.

128 - 64 - 32 - 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1
<br>
0 - 1  - 1 -  0  - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

64 + 32 + 4 = 100
