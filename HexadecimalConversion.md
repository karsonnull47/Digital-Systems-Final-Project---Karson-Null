# Hexadecimal Conversion

### Hexadecimal values are when stretches of four binary digits equate to 0-9 or A-F.

The number values work the same way that the previously mentioned number conversion works, the rightmost value represents 1, and the value doubles.
<br>
8 - 4 - 2 - 1
<br>
Like this.
<br> 
<br>
However values that exceed 9, then roll over into translating letters.
<br>
<br>
Example:
<br>
10 = A
<br>
11 = B
<br>
12 = C
<br>
13 = D
<br>
14 = E
<br> 
15 = F
<br>
<br>
15 is the highest possible value that can be represented using 4 binary numbers.
